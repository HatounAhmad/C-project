## Postfix Expression Evaluation Using Stack

This code was developed as part of a course on data structures.

### Overview:
The code evaluates postfix arithmetic expressions by applying the postfix evaluation algorithm, which utilizes a stack-based approach. It takes a postfix expression as input and calculates its value.

### Features:
- Handles arithmetic expressions with double values.
- Supports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
- Supports exponentiation (^) and modulus (%) operations.
