## Infix to Postfix Conversion Using Stack
This code was developed as part of a course on data structures.
This code implements an algorithm to convert infix arithmetic expressions to postfix notation. It takes an infix expression as input and applies the rules of infix to postfix conversion to produce the equivalent postfix expression.
