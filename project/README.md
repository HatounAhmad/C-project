##   Library Simulator   


   Welcome to the Library Simulator project! ðŸ“š

   This project began as a simple simulation of a library, but I couldn't resist adding a little fun to it! As a first-year CS student, I wanted to practice my programming skills and make the project more enjoyable. So, I added features like a Rock-Paper-Scissors game, quizzes, and even song recommendations to spice things up.

   Project Features:
   - Library Simulation: Browse through a virtual library, select books, and even decide whether to borrow or purchase them.
   - Rock-Paper-Scissors Game: Challenge the computer to a classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors.
   - Quizzes: Test your knowledge with fun quizzes on various topics.
   - Song Recommendations: Get recommendations for songs based on different genres.
   
# How My Program Works:
   First, it will show you a menu table which consists of:
  - a. GAMES/Quizzes
  - b. GAMES/ROCK PAPER SCISSORS
  - c. BOOK LIBRARY
  - d. SONGS RECOMMENDATIONS

   If the user enters (a), another window will appear with options:
   - Enter 1 to start the game
   - Enter 2 for help
   - Enter 3 to exit

   If the user enters 1, a quiz game will start with 10 questions. If all questions are answered correctly, a congratulatory message will display with the score. Otherwise, a message will inform the user of incorrect answers and encourage them to try again.

   If the user enters 2 for help, relevant information will be displayed, and the user can go back or exit.

   If the user enters 3, the program will stop execution.

   If the user enters (b), the Rock Paper Scissors game will begin. The user will play three rounds against the computer, with each round displaying the winner. After three rounds, the player can choose to exit or go back to the main menu.

   If the user enters (c), the book library will open with a welcome message prompting the user to enter their name. The user can then select books from different categories, view book details, and choose to borrow or purchase.

   If the user enters (d) for song recommendations, a welcome message will appear, followed by a list of music genres to choose from. After selecting a genre, popular and new release songs will be displayed.

# Feel free to play! ðŸš€ðŸŽ¶
